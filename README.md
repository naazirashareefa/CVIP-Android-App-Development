This project is a **To-Do List Reminder application** developed using **Python**. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to manage their daily tasks with time-based reminders. The graphical interface is built using the **Tkinter** library, while **threading** is used to handle background countdown timers for each task. Users can input a task description along with a time duration in hours. Once submitted, each task is assigned a unique ID and begins counting down in real time. The task list on the interface displays all active tasks along with their remaining time in hours. When the time for a task runs out, the application automatically removes it from the list and displays a pop-up notification using **`tk.messagebox`**, reminding the user that the time for that task is up.

The application supports additional features such as updating and deleting tasks. Users can select an existing task, modify its text or time, and save the changes. The interface includes dedicated input fields for editing and buttons for updating and saving changes. The real-time countdown functionality is handled through **threading.Timer**, which decreases the remaining seconds for each task every second. The task list is refreshed continuously to reflect the updated time or any changes made by the user.

Internally, the application uses a **dictionary** to store tasks with their corresponding details like text and remaining time. It also makes use of **Tkinter variables** such as `StringVar` and `DoubleVar` to manage the state of the input fields. The application demonstrates effective use of **event-driven programming**, **multi-threading**, and **GUI design**. Overall, it serves as a lightweight yet functional desktop tool for personal task management and is a good example of integrating timers and reminders in Python applications.
